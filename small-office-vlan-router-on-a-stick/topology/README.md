# Office VLAN Topology with Router-on-a-Stick + DHCP

This project demonstrates **enterprise-style VLAN segmentation with inter-VLAN routing** and centralized DHCP, simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. This topology mimics **real-world enterprise networks** where VLAN segmentation is used for security and performance, with centralized DHCP for management efficiency.

## üñºÔ∏è Network Topology
 ‚öôÔ∏è Networking Devices
- **R1** ‚Äì Router-on-a-stick (handles inter-VLAN routing + DHCP)
- **SW1** ‚Äì Core switch for HR + IT VLANs
- **SW2** ‚Äì Access switch for Finance VLAN

 ‚öôÔ∏è Connection details
| Device   | Interface      | Connected To   | Port       | VLAN    |
|----------|----------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| Internet | -              | R1             | -          | -       |
| R1       | Gig0/0         | SW1 (Gi0/1)    | Trunk      | VLAN 10,20,30 |
| SW1      | Fa0/1          | HR-PC1         | Access     | VLAN 10 |
| SW1      | Fa0/2          | HR-PC2         | Access     | VLAN 10 |
| SW1      | Fa0/3          | IT-PC1         | Access     | VLAN 20 |
| SW1      | Fa0/4          | IT-PC2         | Access     | VLAN 20 |
| SW1      | Gig0/2         | SW2 (Gi0/1)    | Trunk      | VLAN 10,20,30 |
| SW2      | Fa0/1          | Finance-PC1    | Access     | VLAN 30 |
| SW2      | Fa0/2          | Finance-PC2    | Access     | VLAN 30 |

 ‚öôÔ∏è VLANs configured
| VLAN ID | Department | Subnet            | Default GW    |
|---------|------------|------------------|---------------|
| 10      | HR         | 192.168.10.0/24  | 192.168.10.1  |
| 20      | IT         | 192.168.20.0/24  | 192.168.20.1  |
| 30      | Finance    | 192.168.30.0/24  | 192.168.30.1  |

Based on the above topology, when creating the topology in Cisco packet Tracer, the configs files r1.cfg, sw1.cfg, and sw2.cfg, are used to configure r1, sw1, and sw2 in their *CLI interface* respectively.

## üöÄ Features
- **Router-on-a-Stick** for inter-VLAN routing
- **DHCP** for each VLAN
- **Trunk Links** between router & switches
- **Access Ports** per VLAN
- Portfolio-ready configs and verification steps

---

## üìù How to Run
1. Open `office_vlan_topology.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Apply configs from `configs/` folder
3. Run verification commands and paste outputs into `verification/`
4. Test connectivity with `ping` from PCs

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist
- Router sub-interfaces UP: `show ip interface brief`
- VLANs configured: `show vlan brief`
- Trunks UP: `show interfaces trunk`
- PCs received IPs via DHCP
- Successful ping tests across VLANs
