# Office VLAN Topology with Router-on-a-Stick + DHCP

This project demonstrates **enterprise-style VLAN segmentation with inter-VLAN routing** and centralized DHCP, simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

- **R1** ‚Äì Router-on-a-stick (handles inter-VLAN routing + DHCP)
- **SW1** ‚Äì Core switch for HR + IT VLANs
- **SW2** ‚Äì Access switch for Finance VLAN

## üöÄ Features
- **Router-on-a-Stick** for inter-VLAN routing
- **DHCP** for each VLAN
- **Trunk Links** between router & switches
- **Access Ports** per VLAN
- Portfolio-ready configs and verification steps

---

## üìù How to Run
1. Open `office_vlan_topology.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Apply configs from `configs/` folder
3. Run verification commands and paste outputs into `verification/`
4. Test connectivity with `ping` from PCs

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist
- Router sub-interfaces UP: `show ip interface brief`
- VLANs configured: `show vlan brief`
- Trunks UP: `show interfaces trunk`
- PCs received IPs via DHCP
- Successful ping tests across VLANs

---

## üîÆ Notes
This topology mimics **real-world enterprise networks** where VLAN segmentation is used for security and performance, with centralized DHCP for management efficiency.
